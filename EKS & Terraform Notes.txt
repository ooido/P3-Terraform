Questions:

    How do we publicly expose the cluster to the internet? That is, in a way that our servers can actually serve requests from outside the cluster.
        Maybe the answer is with nginx deployment & ingresses, and then a loadbalancer or cluster IP? What is going on here?
        Do we need to modify VPC?
        Do we need to do something with the public IP?

    How can we automate the setup we need?
        nginx
        Metrics server
        Dashboard
        Prometheus
        Grafana
        Jenkins

    How do we persist these using Persistent Volumes and PersistentVolumeClaims?
